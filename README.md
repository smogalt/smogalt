hey im a student interested in compsci, networking and unix. mostly code in c but im learning go. 
*if you want me to rewrite in rust its not going to happen but if you want to do it, go for it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯*

im improving my DSA skills with some leetcode and reading but im not FAANG ready yet

look for some GO projects in the future but i still have to learn the language
