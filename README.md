im a student interested in compsci, networking and unix. mostly code in CğŸ’€ but im learning GO. 

*if you want me to rewrite anything in rust its not going to happen but if you want to do it, go for it Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯*

im improving my DSA skills with some leetcode and reading but im not FAANG ready yet

look for some GO projects in the future but i still have to learn the language

ciao :)
